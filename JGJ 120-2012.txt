4.5.4 The dynamic consolidation construction shall meet the following requirements:
The tamping point position and its contour line shall be marked out before tamping, the ground elevation shall be measured before and after tamping. and the tamping settlement for tamping on each point shall be calculated;
After each tamping, the tamping pit shall be timely filled and levelled or bulldozed, and the site elevation shall be measured to calculate the site tamping settlement for this tamping; 
After full compacting times are completed, the loose soil on site surface layer shall be compacted and rolled with low energy full tamping in the tamping principle of lapping 1/5 ~ 1/3 of hammer diameter, and the site elevation after dynamic consolidation shall be measured.
The dynamic consolidation shall be carried out by area, from border area to middle part or from the side of adjacent buildings (structures) to the side far away.
4.5.5 The construction of dynamic replacement shall meet the following requirements:
The material of dynamic replacement pier should be adopted with with coarse particle materials with hard texture and stable performance such as well-graded block stone, gravel and slag, and the content of particle with the size greater than 300mm should not be greater than 30% of the full weight; 
The piling principle at tamping point should be interlaced skip piling from inside out;
The site elevation shall be measured after each tamping and uplifting amount of site for each tamping shall be calculated, the part of uplifting amount exceeding design elevation should be timely eliminated.
4.5.6 For soft soil area and area with lighter groundwater depth, the construction by dewatering in conjunction with low level dynamic consolidation shall meet the following requirements:
The dewatering and drainage system shall be arranged first before the construction of dynamic consolidation; the dewatering system should be adopted with vacuum well point system, the peripheral closed well point should be arranged 3m-4m outside the reinforced area;
The dewatering equipment in tamping area shall be removed at least 2 days after the groundwater level lowers to design water level and is stable;
The low level dynamic consolidation shall be in the principle of piling lightly first and then heavily at little point and for multiple times;
The rest time for each pass of dynamic consolidation should be determined according to that the excess pore water pressure dissipation is not less than 80%;
The construction site in area with lighter groundwater depth should be arranged with longitudinal and horizontal drainage network, drainage network and the maximum spacing of drainage network should not be greater than 15m.
